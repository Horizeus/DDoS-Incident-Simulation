# 🚨 DDoS Incident Analysis: ICMP Flood Attack

This project is a real-world simulation and analysis of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack using ICMP flood techniques. It includes a complete incident response based on the NIST cybersecurity framework: **Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover**.

---

## 📄 Summary

- **Type of Attack:** ICMP Flood (Ping of Death)
- **Effect:** Caused network-wide disruption, unresponsive internal services
- **Root Cause:** Firewall misconfiguration that allowed unrestricted ICMP traffic
- **Response:** Blocked ICMP traffic, shut down non-essentials, restored key systems
- **Tools Used:** IDS, firewall logging, SIEM integration, network monitoring
