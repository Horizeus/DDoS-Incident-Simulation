# ðŸ“‘ DDoS Incident Report (Markdown Version)

## 1. Summary
Our organization, a multimedia company specializing in web and graphic design, experienced a DDoS attack via ICMP Flood. The high volume of ping packets overwhelmed the network, halting internal communications. Response steps were taken to contain and recover.

## 2. Identify
- **Attack Type:** ICMP Flood (Ping of Death)
- **Impact:** Internal traffic blocked, network resources inaccessible
- **Cause:** Misconfigured firewall that allowed unrestricted ICMP

## 3. Protect
- **Firewall Rule Configuration:** Rate-limiting for ICMP packets
- **IP Source Verification:** Block spoofed addresses
- **Access Control Policies:** Segmentation and least privilege enforcement
- **Patch Management:** Regular updates to systems and firmware
- **Training:** Employee awareness to report network issues

## 4. Detect
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Monitors for known attack patterns
- **Firewall Logging:** Logs all incoming ICMP, generates threshold alerts
- **Traffic Monitoring:** Tools like Wireshark or Zabbix
- **Baseline Behavior Analysis:** Detects traffic anomalies
- **SIEM Integration:** Centralized logging and correlation

## 5. Respond
- **Blocked ICMP Traffic:** Immediate containment
- **Shut Down Non-Critical Services:** Reduce load and stabilize
- **Restored Critical Services:** Phased reactivation
- **Collected Logs:** For forensic analysis
- **Followed IR Plan:** Documented and assigned roles
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Transparent updates throughout

## 6. Recover
- **Full System Restoration:** Non-critical services returned gradually
- **Validation:** Ensured integrity and availability
- **Post-Incident Review:** Lessons learned and process improvement
- **Updated IR Plan:** Based on findings
- **Improved Resilience:** Redundancy and enhanced alerting added
- **Recovery Communication:** Confirmed resolution to internal stakeholders

## 7. Reflections
This was a critical learning moment for the team. It highlighted the importance of proactive defense, visibility, and an agile response plan.
